# Covid-19 Tracker 

Displays current trends of Covid-19 cases, deaths, and recovered both global and local. Use the line chart to toggle between trend categories. Hover over the map chart to see the latest data on new cases. 

## Motivation

I wanted to outline the current corona virus cases to see if it was getting better or not. That's why I built a simple web app that displays the latests statistics of the Covid-19 Pandemic. Take a look at the top countries that have been effected the most. Also, users can view trends of confirmed cases for the past 30 days in the United states.
